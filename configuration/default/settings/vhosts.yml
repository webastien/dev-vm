# This VM will build sites defined here, here is some examples.
#
# The most basic:
# Simply add an entry with an empty hash. The entry name is the main domain
#
# (by default, see starters.yml)
# This one will not have associated DB and its content will be a phpinfo() by default.
# In fact, this is the key "starter" which falls back to "empty", (by default, again)
# so it's the same as adding "starter: empty" or "starter: a-starter-not-found".
#
# By default, only "empty" (this one), adminer, "drupal7" and "drupal8" are implemented.
# Take a look at files in "starters" folder, and eventualy add you ones to yours/starters.
phpinfo.seb: {}

# Very basic with the simple starter "adminer"
adminer.seb: { starter: adminer }

# Here is the "full" example:
#
# db_name: Name of associated database, falls back to domain name, without tld.
#          Dots in resulting db_name (sub-domains) are replaced by underscores.
#   example: "foo.bar.baz" domain will produces "foo_bar" db_name.
#
# db_user / db_pass are respectively the username and the password to connect to it.
#
# The database and the user (full access granted on it) will be created automaticaly.
drupal8.seb:
  starter: drupal8
  modules: [ devel, bootstrap ] # Optional list of Drupal modules / themes
  db_name: drupal8  # Read above
  db_user: drupal8  # If omitted, take the "db_name" value
  db_pass: drupal8  # If omitted, the password is null
  aliases:
    - www.drupal8.seb  # Aliases are optional
    -  fr.drupal8.seb
    -  en.drupal8.seb
  # Arguments passed to drush site-install, default to --site-name=<domain> --account-pass=admin
  drush_si_args:  --account-pass=admin --locale=fr --site-name="Drupal8 starter" # --db-url always passed
  drush_commands:  # (optional) List of drush commands executed after site has been installed
    - config-set system.theme default bootstrap  # Those commands are executed after "drush pm-enable"

# A more simple example of site using a drupal7 starter...
drupal7.seb:
  starter: drupal7
  aliases: [ www.drupal7.seb ]
